  /**
  Cancels all the cancellables stored in the array.

  This function cancels all the cancellable objects that have been added to the cancellables array. It uses the cancel() function of each Cancellable element in the array to stop any ongoing operations or subscriptions.
   
  Usage:
  ```
   viewModel.unsubscribe()
  ```
  - Note: This function does not remove the cancelled elements from the cancellables array.
   
   The unsubscribe() function is a method that cancels all the cancellable objects in the cancellables array. It iterates through each element in the array and calls its cancel() function to stop any ongoing operations or subscriptions.

   It is important to note that this function does not remove the cancelled elements from the cancellables array. If you want to remove the cancelled objects from the array, you will need to do so manually.

   You can call this function on an instance of an object that has an array of cancellable objects, like so: myObject.unsubscribe().

  func unsubscribe() {
    cancellables.forEach { element in
      element.cancel()
    }
  }

   /**
   Updates the app state based on the provided input state.

   This function is called whenever the app state changes, and it takes a single argument, state, that represents the new state of the app. The function should update the app's internal state based on the input state, which may include changes to data, user interface, or other app components.

   This function should be overridden in subclasses to customize the behavior of the app when the state changes.

   - Parameters:
     - state: An instance of the AppState struct that represents the new state of the app.

   - Throws:
     This function may throw an error if an error occurs during its execution. Subclasses should document the types of errors that this function may throw, and callers should be prepared to handle these errors.

   - Usage:
     You can call this function whenever you need to update the app state, typically in response to user input or other events that affect the app's behavior.

   - Example:
     Here's an example of how you might use the update function to update the app's internal state based on a change in the user's selection of a color:

         let newState = AppState(selectedColor: .red)
         update(state: newState)

     Note that this is just an example, and the actual usage of the update function may vary depending on the specific requirements of your app.

   - Subclassing:
     Subclasses should override this function to provide custom behavior when the app state changes. The default implementation of this function does nothing.
