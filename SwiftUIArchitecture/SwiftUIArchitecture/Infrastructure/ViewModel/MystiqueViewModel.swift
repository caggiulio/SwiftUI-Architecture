  Cancels all the cancellables stored in the array.

  This function cancels all the cancellable objects that have been added to the cancellables array. It uses the cancel() function of each Cancellable element in the array to stop any ongoing operations or subscriptions.
   
  Usage:
  ```
   viewModel.unsubscribe()
  ```
  - Note: This function does not remove the cancelled elements from the cancellables array.
   
   The unsubscribe() function is a method that cancels all the cancellable objects in the cancellables array. It iterates through each element in the array and calls its cancel() function to stop any ongoing operations or subscriptions.

   It is important to note that this function does not remove the cancelled elements from the cancellables array. If you want to remove the cancelled objects from the array, you will need to do so manually.

   You can call this function on an instance of an object that has an array of cancellable objects, like so: myObject.unsubscribe().
